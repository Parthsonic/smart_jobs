/*
 * 
 * I have to add Principal to get the current user id 
 * so that I can set foreign key.
 * 
 * Right now there is no FK set.
 * 
 *  @IntroOfPrincipal: The principal is the currently logged in user. 
 *  	However, you retrieve it through the security context which 
 *  	is bound to the current thread and as such it's also bound 
 *  	to the current request and its session.SecurityContextHolder.getContext() 
 *  	internally obtains the current SecurityContext implementation through a ThreadLocal 
 *  	variable. Because a request is bound to a single thread this will get you the context 
 *  	of the current request.To simplify you could say that the security context is 
 *  	in the session and contains user/principal and roles/authorities.
 *  	
 *  How do I retrieve a specific user? 
 *  	You don't. All APIs are designed to allow access to the user 
 *  	& session of the current request. Let user A be one of 100 
 *  	currently authenticated users. If A issues a request against your 
 *  	server it will allocate one thread to process that request. 
 *  	If you then do SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication() 
 *  	you do so in the context of this thread. By default from within 
 *  	that thread you don't have access to the context of user B which 
 *  	is processed by a different thread.
 *	
 *	How do I differentiate between users that are doing requests?
 *		You don't have to, that's what the Servlet container does for you.
